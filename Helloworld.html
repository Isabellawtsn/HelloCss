        <p>This is a project to get a good grip on CSS and its properties.</p>

        <p>So it occured to me that it would be hard to do extensive CSS coding if I do not have enough HTML. So I am going to write a few things about myself such as: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Why I want to learn code</li>
            <li>My Favorite things</li>
            <li>Where I want to move and why</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So hold on because I will be switching between writing HTML and CSS, though the person reading its finished format won't know; but I think thre is a way to see what changes were made when.</p>

        <p>Oh and maybe I'll add some Javascript just for kicks snd giggles.</p>
